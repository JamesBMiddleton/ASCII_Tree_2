## ASCII_Tree_2

ASCII_tree uses procedural generation to produce coloured tree-like structures in a terminal window using ASCII characters - every tree generated is unique. Inspired by [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai). 

ASCII_Tree_2 is an extension of ASCII_Tree which allows multiple trees and branches to grow in parallel. 

__Requirements__: <br>
Must be run in a terminal emulator that supports ANSI escape codes and 24 bit colour. <br>
_Supported_ - Konsole (KDE), Xterm, Iterm (MacOS), libvte (GNOME, Xfce). <br>
_Unsupported_ - Windows CMD, Powershell (unless 24 bit colour is manually enabled).
